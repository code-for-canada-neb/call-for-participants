# National Energy Board - User recruitement

Code for Canada https://codefor.ca, in collaboration with the National Energy Board http://neb-one.gc.ca, are looking for participants external to this organization to participate in a series of workshops. These workshops will explore uses of a regulatory documents database, REGDOCS, and will take approximately 1 hour. Workshops will be conducted remotely and in person based on needs. We are also seeking participants to test prototypes.

These studies will guide the product direction for increasing accessibility, discoverability, and participation within a publicly available database.

For more information on REGDOCS, please visit https://apps.neb-one.gc.ca/REGDOCS/
